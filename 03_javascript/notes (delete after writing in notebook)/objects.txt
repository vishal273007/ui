Objects:
Objects are physical entities which contains properties and methods.
eg.: let obj = {
    name: "raj",
    age: 30,
    email: 'a@a.com'
}

objects can be accessed by dot notation(objectName.propertyName) or index signature(objectname['propertyname']).


By default, everything in javascript ends up as object. There is underlying inheritance called prototype inheritance.

Operators are used to perform and operation and between operands.
E.g.: a + b is an addition operation with + as an operator and a, b as operands.

There are several operators sush as:
    i. Arithmetic Operators
        Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic arithmetic operations.
        '+' -- used for addtition
        '-' -- used for subraction
        '*' -- used for multiplication
        '/' -- used for division -- It will give exact value unlike other programming language. 10/2 = 5 in js, and 10/2 = 0 in python, java.
        '%' -- used for remainder -- 7/2 = 3.5 ,, 7%2 = 1.
        '**' -- used for power, eg 2**3 = 2*2*2 = 8. or [math.pow().]
    
    2. Relational Operators:
        Relational operators are used to perform comparisons and returns boolean values. 
        E.g.
        > -- greater than
        < -- less than
        >= -- greater than or equals to
        <= -- less than or equals to
        == -- double equals is used to compare two values.
        === -- triple equals is used to compare two values and datatypes.
        != -- will be true when both values are not equals to each other
        !== -- will be true when both values are not equals to each other or datatypes.
        e.g. '5' == 5 --> True, '5' === 5 --> False
        0 == false --> true, 0 === false --> F
        '1' == true -- T, '1' === --> F.

    3. Logical Operators:
        Logical operators are used to perform logical conditions, such as:
            
            AND -- && -- Both values are true. Used to check multiple conditions based on AND.
            E.g.: (5>2) && (5>4) -- True

            OR -- || -- True when any of the condition is True. Used to check multiple conditions based on OR.
            e.g.: (5>2) || (5>6) -- True
            
            NOT --! - Used to check whether condition is false or not.
            e.g.: !(10>5) --!(true) --> False.

    
    4. Assignment Operators:
        Assignment operators are used to assign certain values.
        = --> a = 5;
        += -->  eg: a += 2 : a = a+2
        -= --> eg: a -= 2 : a = a-2
        *= --> eg: a *= 2 : a = a*2
        /= --> eg: a /= 2 : a = a/2
        %= --> eg: a %= 2 : a = a%2
        **= --> eg: a **= 2 : a = a**2


    5. Icrement and Decrement Operators:
        Increment and Decrement operators are used to increase or decrease the value by 1.
        Increment(++): Increment can be done in two ways
            1. pre-increment: pre-increment first increases the value and then assigns the value.
            eg.: ++a 

            2. post-increment: post-increment first assigns the value and then increments the value.
            eg.: a++;

            Same applies to decrement also.

    6. Ternary Operators:
        Ternary operators are used to choose between two options based on a condition.
        e.g.: 
        let c = a>5 ? 10:20; (short form of if statement)
        if the statement (a > 5) is true, then c = 10;
        else c = 20;

    7. unary + or unary - : These are used to convert any datatype to numbers. "unary +" is recommended to use.

    8. nullish coelsion operator: it is used to when the decision needs to be done with empty or unknown values.

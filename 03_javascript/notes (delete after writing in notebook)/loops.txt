Loops: loops repeat again and again. each repition is called iteration. we have primarily two types of loops in javascript

1. entry controlled loops: for, while, etc.

2. exit controlled loops: do while.

1. entery controlled loops: these loops checks the condition at the starting a loop.
A loop contains three phases: (initialization, condition, updation)

2. exit contrlled loops:  these loops check the condition at the exit. eg: dowhile.

while: while is an entry controlled loop which is used to iterate certain statements according to a condition.
syntax: 
    initialization;
    while(condition){
        //code;
        updation;
    }

dowhile : initialization;
do{
    //code;
    //updation
} while(condition);
